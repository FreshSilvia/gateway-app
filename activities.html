         <h2> Japan Onsens</h2>
         <p>
          Depending on which Onsen you go to the cost could vary. If you go to an onsen inn then it could be free after you check in. There is no target age group for getting in a onsen. Most onsen's are divided by gender, but kids under the age of 7 are able to accompany a parent or guardian of either gender. Onsen is the Japanese name for hot spring. Since Japan is a volcanically active country the onsens use naturally hot water from geothermally heated springs. Traditional onsens are mostly located outside. They offer great scenery while you soak in the bath. Great for relaxing after a long day.
